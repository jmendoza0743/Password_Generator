## Second Homework Assignment 
We were tasked with making a random password generator that asked the user if what characters they wanted to include such as uppercase letters, lowercase letter, numbers and special characters, and the lenght of the password.

## Technologies
Used Javascript to write to code to randomly generate the password based on the user's selection.

## How to Use
Download files and run the files in the browser. The user will then be prompted to enter what character types to include and the lenght of the password. 

## Credits
This was compiled using a variety of sources including class notes and powerpoints, assistance from the TAs and instructor, classmates and websites like W3Schools.com. Also used stackoverflow to help troubleshoot the issues that were encountered.
